# You are given a 1-indexed array of integers numbers that is already sorted in non-decreasing order.


# Find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number. Let these two numbers be numbers[index1] and numbers[index2] where 1 <= index1 < index2 <= numbers.length.


# Return the indices of the two numbers index1 and index2 as an integer array [index1, index2] of length 2.

# The tests are generated such that there is exactly one solution. You may not use the same element twice.

# Your solution must use only constant extra space.
